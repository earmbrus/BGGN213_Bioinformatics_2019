### We're going to look at the structure of the HIV protease and drug binding.
### First, load the Bio3D package and use read.pdb() to pull in the structure with "library(bio3d)". Do this in the console so we don't re-load the package every time you knit the R Markdown file. Use "read.pdb" to birng in the "1hsg" file. Then we're going to create two different pdb files for the ligand and the protein.

### Assign the structure to the name "hiv". Get a quick summary of the object by typing in its name.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```
### Q1: What is the name of the two non protein resid values in this structure? What does resid correspond to and how would you get a listing of all reside values in this structure? 
### The two non protein resid values are "HOH (127)" and "MK1 (1)".

### Produce a "1hsg_protein.pdb" and "1hsg_ligand.pdb" file
### Do the ligand first.
```{r}
ligand <- atom.select(hiv, "ligand", value = TRUE)
write.pdb(ligand, file = "1hsg_ligand.pdb")
```
### Then do the protein.
```{r}
protein <- atom.select(hiv, "protein", value = TRUE)
write.pdb(protein, file = "1hsg_protein.pdb")
```
